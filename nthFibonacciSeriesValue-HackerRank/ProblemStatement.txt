For this question, you will write a program that generates values from the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonnaci sequence is recursively defined by:

Fn = Fn - 1 + Fn - 2

Using the following seed values:

F0 = 0, F1 = 1

Given a number n, print the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence.

Examples
